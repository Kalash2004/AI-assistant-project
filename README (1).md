# AI-Powered Voice Assistant

Welcome to the AI-Powered Voice Assistant project! This project leverages the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to create a voice assistant that can understand and respond to user commands. It is designed to assist with various tasks such as setting reminders, searching the web, controlling smart home devices, and more.


## Features

- Voice Recognition: Understands and processes voice commands to perform various tasks.
- Task Automation: It can automate tasks such as opening websites, fetching the current time, or triggering other system actions.
- Speech Synthesis: Using libraries like win32com, the assistant can speak responses in a natural-sounding voice.
- Custom Commands: You can program custom commands and expand the assistant's capabilities based on your needs.


## Technology Used

- Python
- Speech Recognition (speech_recognition library)
- Text-to-Speech (win32com.client or pyttsx3)
- Web scraping and task automation libraries (optional)
- NLP (for understanding commands, using libraries like NLTK)
- JSON (optional, for storing user-specific commands)


## Setup Instructions

1) Clone this repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-voice-assistant.git

```
2) Navigate into the project folder:
```bash
  cd ai-voice-assistant


```
3) Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt


```
4) Run the voice assistant:
```bash
  python assistant.py


```


## How It Works
- The assistant listens for voice commands using the speech_recognition library.
- It processes the command and identifies the action or query.
- Based on the recognized input, it triggers the relevant function or fetches the appropriate response.
- The assistant can respond to the user using the win32com library for text-to-speech output.
- You can add custom commands and tasks by modifying the code or training the assistant with new NLP models.
